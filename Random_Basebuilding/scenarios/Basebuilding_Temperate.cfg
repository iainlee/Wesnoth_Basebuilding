Foundation Rifts may be placed on any castle tile, or in any villages you control.

They have 2HP and cannot move or attack, but can be transformed into any structure for free. This increases max HP to 30, adds regeneration, and changes their defence to match the units it produces.

More importantly, structures can spawn units under your control depending on the type of structure.

WARNING: Newly-upgraded structures are NOT full-healed and remain on 2HP, but will regenerate to their new max HP (30) in 3 turns if unattacked. Be careful when opening rifts, and do not open them within attack range of enemy units."
